Build a Kanban board component for a recruitment application workflow. I need a drag-and-drop board with 6 columns representing the workflow stages:

- Long List - For Candidates in the Long List
- Short List - For Candidates who are Short Listed
- Interview - For Candidates being Interviewed
- Offer - For Candidates who have been Offered
- Compliance - For Candidates being Compliance Checked
- Onboarding - For Candidates being Onboarded
- Hired - For Candidates being Hired

Each column should:
- Display the stage name clearly
- Show a count of cards in that column
- Allow drag-and-drop functionality between columns
- Support adding new Application cards

Each Application card should include:
- Article title/topic
- Brief description or notes
- Priority indicator (high/medium/low)
- Due date or target timeline
- Current status within that stage

Please use ShadCN components like Card, Badge, Button, and any drag-and-drop utilities available, if you do not find the exact names of these components use something components that are very similar. Make it clean, professional, and suitable for a content writer's daily workflow. Include sample article cards in different stages to demonstrate the workflow.
